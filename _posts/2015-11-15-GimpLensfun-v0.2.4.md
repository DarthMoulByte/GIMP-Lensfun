Final version 0.2.4 of GimpLensfun is now available.

Changes:

* basic support for non interactive mode
* avoid crash when camera or lens is not found in the database
* support for makers which are not in the pre-defined list

__Please note that windows package is experimental and we cannot give any support on that platform!__
If there is anybody out there who is willing to take over maintenance of an official windows installer please contact us.

__EDIT 2015/12/20 The windows installer has been updated. The previous version did not properly load the database.__
