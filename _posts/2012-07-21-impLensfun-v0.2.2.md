Changes:

* Lanczos interpolation is now used instead of bilinear interpolation for sharper results
* crash on unknown exif is fixed
* settings are stored and reloaded if no exif data is present 

Sadly I could not succeed in compiling with GIMP 2.8 on Windows, so there is currently no installer available. If anyone created a binary for Windows please send it to me and I will publish it on this page.
